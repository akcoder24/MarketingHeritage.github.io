                                        The only real sign of Patan’s former glory is this astoundingly beautiful step-well. Located on the banks of the Saraswati River, this is one of the oldest and finest step-wells in Gujarat and is remarkably preserved. Steps lead down through multiple levels with lines of carved pillars and more than 800 sculptures, mostly on Vishnu-avatar themes, as well as striking geometric patterns. The stepwell is made in the form of an inverted temple. It showcases superior craftsmanship of the era, and the unique Maru-Gurjara architectural style and houses sculptures similar to the Vimalavasahi temple in Mount Abu and Sun temple at Modhera. This 900-year old structure is located about 125 km from Ahmedabad, in Patan, which was a fortified city in medieval times. Even though step-wells were constructed in India since 3rd BC as a means of storing water, Rani ki Vav is much more than that. It has gained huge popularity due to its elaborate seven-storied structure and intricately carved sculptures of gods, goddesses, and deities.

                                        Rani ki Vav traces its origins back to the 11th century when the Chalukya Dynasty was in power. The popular assumption is that the well was commissioned in 1063 by Rani Udayamati for her husband Raja Bhimdev I. A collection of semi-historical Sanskrit narratives named Prabandha Chintamani, compiled in the 14th century, has references to the queen building this memorial for her beloved husband. As years passed, the River Saraswati changed its course and this stepwell was extensively damaged and silted by floods. Due to repetitive floods and river deposits, this massive structure received little attention and was almost buried under the sand. In the late 1980s, the Archaeological Survey of India started excavations on the site, desilting and restoring the structure to its present form. The stepwell was later flooded by the Saraswati river and silted over. In the 1890s, Henry Cousens and James Burgess visited it when it was completely buried under the earth and only a well shaft and few pillars were visible. They described it as being a huge pit measuring 87 metres (285 ft). In  Travels in Western India, James Tod mentioned that the material from the stepwell was reused in the other stepwell built-in modern Patan, probably Trikam Barot ni Vav (Bahadur Singh stepwell). In the 1940s, excavations carried out under the Baroda State revealed the stepwell. In 1986, major excavation and restoration were carried out by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). An image of Udayamati was also recovered during the excavation. The restoration was carried out from 1981 to 1987.

                                        India is filled with monuments dedicated by a lot of kings in the fond memory of their queens. However, Rani ki Vav stands as an exceptional case, it was built in the loving memory of Bhimdev I by his widowed Queen Udayamati around 1050 AD. Rani ki Vav translates to 'Queen's Stepwell'. This well was built with almost every sculpture idolising Lord Ram and Vishnu in one form or the other. Built-in the 11th century, Rani Ki Vav is popularly believed to have been buried underground owing to a flood in the river Saraswati, though opinion is divided on that. Some believe the Vav was simply silted up over time. In a region where several areas have traditionally had to deal with water scarcity, step-wells are not uncommon. But what sets Rani Ki Vav apart is its sheer size and fine craftsmanship. Measuring 64 metres in length and 27 metres in-depth, it is a subterranean seven-storey structure, lavishly adorned with sculptures of gods, goddesses and other mythological and heavenly creatures that give it the look of a royal or divine abode.

                                        The finest and one of the largest examples of its kind and designed as an inverted temple highlighting the sanctity of water, the stepwell is divided into seven levels of stairs with sculptural panels; more than 500 principal sculptures of Bhagwan Vishnu and over 1000 minor ones combine religious and Legendary imagery. Constructed in the Maru-Gurjara architectural style, this east-facing memorial is spread over 12 acres of land. Rani ki Vav is 64 meters long, 20 meters wide and 27 meters deep, and is designed like an inverted temple. That is, the structure begins from the ground level with steps leading to the bottom of the deep well below. In addition to steps, there are supplementary staircases that can be used to reach the lower stories. The draw well is situated in the extreme west of the structure. Needless to say, Rani ki Vav shows mastery of complex techniques and a great display of details and proportion.  The well has seven stories, each featuring sculptures of spellbinding artistic quality. You can see a combination of religious, mythological, and secular imageries in the 500 plus main sculptures and several minor ones. There are around 226 pillars in this stepwell that remain intact even after the repetitive floods. The corridors, pavilions, and pillars are intricately carved with the figures of Hindu deities, gods and apsaras or celestial dancers. The carving of Sheshashayi Vishnu, where he is seen as reclining on a serpent with thousand hoods, is one of the key attractions to check out.

                                    In an era where kings immortalised queens, the Rani ki vav stands apart immortalising a queen’s love for a king. But what’s more? It has fine craftsmanship that combines both devotion and the purpose of a step-well. Having more than 500 sculptures this place stands apart in every aspect. The most notable fact is that the upper part of every pillar is made of a woman who is seen to have supported the monument, carefully symbolising the role of every woman in society in that era.
